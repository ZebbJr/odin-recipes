            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p> Have you ever seen the ingredients on those frozen 
                blocks of lasagna? Nobody needs to have soy sauce in 
                an italian dish.  Making it yourself is quite easy and 
                being in control of what's actually inside makes it 
                taste less like plastic and tomato paste. A surprising
                amount of flavor can be injected when you make it yourself. 
            </p>
            <p> Now cooking is different from baking in that you don't
                require an actual recipe.  But here is a Polish perspective
                on the matter. This recipe will pack a protein punch and
                other ingredients that will make it "look" like lasagna.
            </p>
