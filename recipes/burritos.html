            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p> This is another recipe that close enough to the real
                thing. It might not be the best tasting thing available
                but it's good enough.  Authentic burritos require real
                tortillas that are made from lard, not the garbage that
                store bought products provide.  Making authentic anything
                means making everything from scratch and somehow finding
                lard that doesn't have chemicals added to it so good luck
                with "authentic" anything.
            </p>
            <p> Now cooking is different from baking in that you don't
                require an actual recipe.  But here is a Polish perspective
                on the matter.
