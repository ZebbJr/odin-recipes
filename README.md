A display of the basic things that can be used to create 
a basic HTML file system which will display in a web 
browser. The HTML file system could display:

- Different use of text format and size
- words/phrases having some emphasis and some strength
- Different types of links
- Different uses of images and some usually unseen parts of this code
- Some security minded additions that are good practice even in modern times

Beyond this, the near future will add some CSS content as it is learned
during this course.
